# SMART-VIRTUAL-ASSISTANT

The requirement for independent living is 
acknowledged in today's high-tech 
environment for visually impaired persons, 
who mostly struggle with social isolation. They 
struggle in unfamiliar settings without any 
physical assistance. Most tasks rely on visual 
information, thus those who are blind or 
visually impaired are at a disadvantage 
because they lack access to this crucial 
information. Recent developments in inclusive 
technology make it feasible to increase the 
assistance provided to those with visual 
impairment. The goal of this project is to use 
artificial intelligence assist persons according
to oneâ€™s convenience . A WebApp that focuses 
on voice assistant and chat bots, and other 
features carries out the concept.The software 
can use voice commands to help you identify 
necessary works. It will be a productive 
approach for individuals to use technology to
engage with their surroundings and take use of 
its features.Virtual assistants, which are a 
component of one of Artificial Intelligence's 
(AI) fastest-growing fields, are now a staple of 
practically every smart device, making them a 
part of everyone's daily lives. The most well nown ones include Alexa, Siri, Google 
Assistant, and Cortana, to name just a few. 
Beyond these pre-made options, there are a 
variety of technologies that enable the 
development of personalised assistants. 
Because of its ease of use and accessibility via 
open APIs, IBM Watson, for example, is one of 
the most extensively used question-answering 
frameworks. In this study, we describe a 
virtual assistant for low cost for students on a 
campus.
